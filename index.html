		<p> I obtained a master's degree in Civil Engineering and also studied Computer Science from South Dakota State University in 2017. 
			While studying for my masters, I focused on transportation data and mobile sensor data. Before my academic pursuits, I worked as a lecturer and Logistics Engineer in Shanghai.
		I earned my PhD degree in Computer Science from North Carolina State University in 2023. During my PhD study, I had worked in the <a href="https://research.csc.ncsu.edu/wisn/">Wolfpack Interactive, Sensing, and Networking Lab</a>  
	        advised by <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~mshahza/">Dr. Muhammad Shahzad</a>. I was a member of <a href="https://wspr.csc.ncsu.edu/people.html"> Wolfpack Security and Privacy Research Lab </a> 
under guidance from <a href="https://anupamdas.org/">Dr. Anupam Das</a>. As a researcher with a background in both Computer Science and Transportation Engineering, I am particularly interested in the intersection 
			of IoT security and privacy, human-computer interaction (HCI), and mobile computing. My research involves the application of AI/ML to 
			explore the use of ubiquitous modalities such as WiFi, cameras, IMU, and sound. My work aims to develop innovative applications 
			that protect personal sensitive data, secure the operations of smart homes and smart transportation systems, and mitigate usage 
			burden. To assess the effectiveness of my systems, I regularly conduct user experiments, studies, and surveys involving over
			a hundred participants under comprehensive IRB protection.
 </p>

	<p style="color:red;"> I am looking for self-motivated students to work together on mobile computing, HCI, AI/GPT for learning, security and privacy problems.</p>
